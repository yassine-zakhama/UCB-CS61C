Synchronous Digital Systems
    Hardware of a processor, e.g., RISC-V, is a Synchronous Digital System
    - Synchronous:
        All operations coordinated by a central clock
        "Heartbeat" of the system!
        4 GHz means 4 billion times a second (clock goes 1,0 4 billion times a second)
    - Digital:
        All values represented by discrete values
        Electrical signals are treated as 1s and 0s; grouped together to form words
        -> take real world analog values (e.g. voltage) and quantize them to be a 0 or a 1 (that is where a bit comes from)

Logic Design
    We’ll study how a modern processor is built; starting with basic elements as building blocks
    Why study hardware design?
        - Understand capabilities and limitations of hw in general and processors in particular
        - What processors can do fast and what they can’t do fast (avoid slow things if you want your code to run fast!)

Switches: Basic Element of Physical Circuit
    Implementing a simple circuit:
        Close switch when A is 1, open when A is 0

    Assert A = close A -> A is 1 / asserted
    Unassert A = open A -> A is 0 / unasserted

    We can compose switches into more complex ones:

        AND:    ___/ ___/ __

                __/ __
        OR:     __|      |__
                |__  __|
                    \

Transistors:
    Semiconductor device to AMPLIFY or SWITCH signals
        Key component in all modern electronics

    Transistor Networks:
        Modern digital systems designed in CMOS
            MOS: Metal-Oxide on Semiconductor
            C for complementary: normally-open and normally-closed switches
            MOS transistors act as voltage-controlled switches

    MOS Transistors
        3 Terminals: Drain, Gate, Source
        Switch action:  if voltage on gate terminal is (some amount) higher/lower than source terminal then conducting
                        path established between drain and source terminals

        - n-channel: open when voltage at G is low, closes when voltage(G) > voltage (S) + e
        - p-channel: n-channel complement: closed when voltage at G is low, opens when voltage(G) > voltage (S) + e

    Transistor Circuit Rep. vs. Block diagram
        Chips are composed of nothing but transistors and wires.
        Small groups of transistors form useful building blocks.
        Block are organized in a hierarchy to build higher-level blocks: ex: adders.
        You can build AND, OR, NOT out of NAND!

Signals and Waveforms: Clocks
    T = 1 / freq

    Signals:
        - When digital is only treated as 1 or 0
        - Is transmitted over wires continuously
        - Transmission is effectively instant
        - Implies that a wire contains 1 value at a time

    Problem: Real world values (e.g. voltage) are noisy, and delayed (not synchronized with a clock)

    Propagation delay is the time it takes for a signal change at the input of a system to produce a corresponding change at the output.
        Measured in nanoseconds (ns) or picoseconds (ps)
        Example: If an inverter’s input changes at time t, and the output changes at t + 2 ns, the propagation delay = 2 ns.
        Where it matters:
            Logic gates: each gate has a non-zero propagation delay
            Combinational circuits: total delay = sum of gate delays on the critical path
            Clock frequency:
                Max clock speed is limited by propagation delay
                Clock period ≥ longest propagation delay

    Type of circuits
        Synchronous Digital Systems are made up of two basic types of circuits:
            Combinational Logic (CL) circuits
                E.g.: adder circuit
                Output is a function of the inputs only.
                Similar to a pure function in mathematics, y = f(x). (No way to store information from one
                    invocation to the next. No side effects)
            State Elements: circuits that store information.
                e.g.: registers, caches, memory, disk, ...

        We need both types

        E.g. Register

                           Input                Register ignore input, until load == 1
                             |                      -> takes input and stores it, holds the state until load is 1 again
                         ____|_____
               Load ____|          |            Often (not always), we clock these devices => load == clock
                        |__________|
                             |
                             |
                           Output

Conclusion:
    Clocks control pulse of our circuits (they are the heartbeat)
